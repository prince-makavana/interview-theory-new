### Pros(Advantages) and Cons(Disadvantages) of Node.Js

## Pros

1) Fast development
2) Easy to learn
3) Better performance in slow network environment - due to single threaded behaviour
4) Highly Scalable

## Cons

1) Performance reduce with heavy computational task
2) Unstable APIs - Due to its rapid development cycle, breaking changes between versions and requiring frequent update
3) Limited CPU intensive operations - Nodejs is not suitable for CPU intensive task as its single threaded. CPU bound task can block the eventloop causing the delays in processing other request.
